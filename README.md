# To Do List
### Brief Description
: An individual project with Software Development Academy to create a To-Do List application.

### Goals
* Use Java to create a functioning To-Do List application
    * Core functionalities: application should allow user to add tasks (with a title and due date), assign tasks to a variety of projects, view tasks (both complete and incomplete), remove tasks, edit tasks, and mark tasks as complete; tasks should be sorted by date, project, or title; the user will interact with the system via a text-based user inteface via the commandline; the user must also be able to quit the application and save the state of the to-do list to a file that can be reloaded when the app is restarted. 
* Create sufficient documentation
* Create design documents as needed to facilitate project
* Design and implement unit testing

### Versions
* [First iteration](https://github.com/jshortz/SDA6ToDoList)
    * Scrapped due to a massive refactoring/restructure of the code
    * Very little work kept from this iteration (which never ran)
* [Second iteration](https://github.com/jshortz/SDAIPv2)
    * Scrapped due to build issues with Gradle/IntelliJ 
        * Most likely due to the project not being created properly in the first place
    * Needed refinement, but worked
    * Work kept and built on for final iteration
* [Final iteration](https://github.com/jshortz/SDAIndProjv2.1)
    * What you're looking at right now
    * Functionalities implemented, tests implemented, documentation added
    * Early reach goals of implementing a GUI and external links removed early in the process

### Resources
* As a very junior developer, I relied on a number of resources in building this project - I've tried to collect them below
1. [link](https://www.mkyong.com/java/java-how-to-save-a-string-to-a-file/) : I used this to review how to save information to files with java.nio
2. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) : I used Stack Overflow to solve a variety of small problems
